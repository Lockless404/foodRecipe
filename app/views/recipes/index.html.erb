        You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
        compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS
        files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
        It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
